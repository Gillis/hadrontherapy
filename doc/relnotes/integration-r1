New features:
- Added HadrontherapyAnalysisFileMessenger
  o Ability to use /analysis/setAnalysisFile <filename> to set the name of the output file
  o Default file name is DoseDistribution.root
  o Works for both ROOT and AIDA analysis (exception: HBOOK output is always DoseDistribution.hbk)
  o Command is available only in "pre-init" state for now
- Direct ROOT analysis support in the HadrontherapyAnalysisManager (bypasses AIDA)
  o Activate by setting G4ROOTANALYSIS_USE=1 and unsetting G4ANALYSIS_USE
  o Both analysis methods can be disabled and in this case there are no external
    dependencies
- INCL/ABLA light ion physics list for deuterons, tritons and alphas
- Added Doxygen documentation tags to some header files and provided a Doxyfile that contains
  Doxygen settings

Bugfixes:
- Light ion hadronic models didn't seem to be activated properly in hadrontherapy-V09-02-15
  o Variable locIonIonInelasticIsRegistered was not inizialized to false in the constructor. This
    produced an error message:
    /physic/addPhysics local_ion_ion_inelastic
    PhysicsList::AddPhysicsList: <local_ion_ion_inelastic> is not defined
