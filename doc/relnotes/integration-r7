Release notes for integration-r7

* New features:
** Produce Bragg peak using the IAEA geometry
** Command based scoring
We now use command based scoring for the bragg peak data. 
The IAEAScoreWriter uses HadrontherapyAnalysisManager to write the output (works with both AIDA and ROOT).
** Normalization fixes to the analysis scripts in RootScripts/iaeaBenchmark/
